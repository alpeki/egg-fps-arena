# Egg-FPS Arena - Actual Implementation Todo List

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FINDINGS
The TODO list claims most features are "âœ… TAMAMLANDI" (COMPLETED), but the codebase contains minimal implementation. The project needs to be rebuilt from scratch.

## ðŸ“‹ ACTUAL WORK REQUIRED

- [ ] Create game state management system
- [ ] Implement player session handling
- [ ] Set up proper server-client communication
- [ ] Fix package.json dependencies (missing Colyseus dependencies)

### Phase 2: Basic Game Logic
- [ ] Implement player entity system
- [ ] Create player movement (WASD controls)
- [ ] Add player aiming system
- [ ] Implement basic health/damage system
- [ ] Create player spawning and respawning logic

### Phase 3: Networking & Netcode
- [ ] Implement authoritative server validation
- [ ] Add client-side prediction
- [ ] Create server reconciliation system
- [ ] Implement snapshot interpolation
- [ ] Add lag compensation techniques

### Phase 4: Weapons & Combat
- [ ] Create hitscan weapon system
- [ ] Implement projectile weapons
- [ ] Add dash mechanic
- [ ] Create damage calculation
- [ ] Implement kill scoring

### Phase 5: Client-Side Implementation
- [ ] Set up Phaser 3 game engine
- [ ] Create game scenes and rendering
- [ ] Implement player sprite and animations
- [ ] Add game UI (health bar, score display)
- [ ] Create input handling system

### Phase 6: AI & Game Modes
- [ ] Implement bot AI system
- [ ] Create free-for-all game mode
- [ ] Add bot spawning and behavior
- [ ] Implement match management

### Phase 7: Polish & Features
- [ ] Add sound effects system
- [ ] Implement visual effects (trails, explosions)
- [ ] Create screen shake and hit feedback
- [ ] Add UI polish (scoreboard, kill feed)
- [ ] Implement connection status indicators

### Phase 8: Content Expansion

- [ ] Implement weapon switching

## ðŸ”§ IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED

### Package Dependencies
- [ ] Install missing Colyseus packages
- [ ] Add Phaser 3 dependency
- [ ] Set up proper TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Fix module resolution issues

### Server Implementation
- [ ] Replace basic WebSocket server with Colyseus
- [ ] Implement proper room management
- [ ] Add player authentication/session handling
- [ ] Create game state synchronization

### Client Setup
- [ ] Create basic Phaser game structure
- [ ] Set up WebSocket client connection
- [ ] Implement basic player rendering
- [ ] Add input event handling

## ðŸ“Š ESTIMATED EFFORT
- **Phase 1-3**: Core multiplayer foundation (Critical - 2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 4-6**: Basic gameplay implementation (Essential - 2-3 weeks)  
- **Phase 7-8**: Polish and content (Nice-to-have - 1-2 weeks)

**Total Estimated Timeline**: 5-8 weeks for basic playable game

## ðŸŽ¯ PRIORITY ORDER
1. **HIGHEST**: Colyseus server setup (Phase 1)
2. **HIGH**: Basic game logic (Phase 2)
3. **MEDIUM**: Netcode implementation (Phase 3)
4. **MEDIUM**: Client-side Phaser setup (Phase 5)
5. **LOW**: Polish and additional features (Phase 7-8)
