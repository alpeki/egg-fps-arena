# Egg-FPS Arena - Implementation Todo List

## üéØ Project Overview
Egg-FPS Arena is a multiplayer FPS game with Colyseus server backend and Phaser 3 client. The server is well-implemented, but several key features are missing or incomplete.

## üìä CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED FEATURES
- **Server Infrastructure**: Full Colyseus room system with player management
- **Game State Management**: Comprehensive player state, movement, combat
- **Networking**: Authoritative server with input handling and validation  
- **Combat System**: Hitscan weapons, damage system, dash mechanics
- **Dependencies**: Proper TypeScript setup with Colyseus and Phaser 3

### ‚ùå MISSING/INCOMPLETE FEATURES
- **Client Implementation**: Basic WebSocket client (needs Colyseus client)
- **Bot AI System**: Completely missing (critical for single-player)
- **Visual Effects**: No particle systems, trails, or impact effects
- **Audio System**: No sound effects or music
- **Game UI**: Basic interface, needs scoreboard, kill feed, etc.

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase 1: Client-Side Improvements
- [ ] Replace WebSocket client with proper Colyseus client
- [ ] Improve Phaser 3 rendering and animations
- [ ] Add comprehensive game UI (health bars, score display, crosshair)
- [ ] Implement client-side prediction rendering
- [ ] Add input smoothing and lag compensation

### Phase 2: AI & Bot System
- [ ] Create basic bot AI framework
- [ ] Implement bot targeting and movement logic
- [ ] Add bot weapon handling and combat behavior
- [ ] Create bot spawning and respawning system
- [ ] Implement bot difficulty scaling

### Phase 3: Visual & Audio Polish
- [ ] Add particle systems for weapons and impacts
- [ ] Implement visual effects (trails, explosions, hit markers)
- [ ] Create screen shake and hit feedback
- [ ] Add sound effects system for weapons and actions
- [ ] Implement connection status indicators

### Phase 4: Game UI & UX
- [ ] Create comprehensive scoreboard UI
- [ ] Implement kill feed system
- [ ] Add main menu and lobby interface
- [ ] Create settings menu
- [ ] Implement game over and statistics screens

### Phase 5: Game Modes & Content
- [ ] Expand weapon types and combat variety
- [ ] Implement power-up system
- [ ] Create multiple maps/environments
- [ ] Add game mode variations (team deathmatch, etc.)
- [ ] Implement weapon switching and customization

### Phase 6: Testing & Optimization
- [ ] Performance optimization for 60fps target
- [ ] Network optimization and bandwidth reduction
- [ ] Memory leak testing and cleanup
- [ ] Multiplayer load testing
- [ ] Bug fixing and stability improvements

## üîß IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### Medium Priority (Polish & UX)
5. [ ] Improve game UI (scoreboard, kill feed, health display)
6. [ ] Add visual feedback (screen shake, hit markers)
7. [ ] Implement client-side prediction improvements
8. [ ] Add basic menu system

### Low Priority (Enhancement)
9. [ ] Add multiple weapon types
10. [ ] Implement power-ups
11. [ ] Create additional maps
12. [ ] Add game mode variations

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Functional multiplayer FPS game with smooth gameplay
- [ ] Bot AI opponents for single-player practice
- [ ] Proper Colyseus client-server integration
- [ ] Engaging visual and audio feedback
- [ ] Intuitive game UI and controls
